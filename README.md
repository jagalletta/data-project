# data-project

## the data file
Located here is a data file called *project-data.txt* 

I feel the need to mention the file name is reversed from the project.  data-project vs project-data.txt

## the goal
--Your task is to read the file and sort or organize by records **by color**.

--Make a GUI.  Bonus for creatively sorting/organizing the records.

I did it with clojure.  You should do it in java.

enjoy!
